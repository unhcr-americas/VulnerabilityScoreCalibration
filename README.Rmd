Vulnerability Scores are key tools used to target and prioritize beneficiaries for specific humanitarian Interventions, such as Cash Based Assistance.  

One challenge is to build scoring formulas that allows to reflects compounded vulnerabilities when different criteria interacts with each others. The goal is therefore to prevents compensability (meaning one criteria can be compensate another one). To do that the geometric aggregations of indicators should be  prefered over arithmetic aggregations (aka multiplying rather than suming). This implies to properly weight each of the criteria used to build the scoring formula. When there's access to a statistically representative dataset of the population such weighting can be performed using a variety of statistical model, but often in humanitarian context such dataset are not available and the weighting is mostly based on expert opinions. 

The goal of {`VulnerabilityScoreCalibration`} is to provide easy access to advanced methods for the development of a vulnerability scorecard calibration through expert opinions. The goal is to build a process enabling full transparency while creating buiy-in and consensus among the experts.

It combines two approaches based on specific type of surveys that can be used to consults the experts:

 * Quadratic Voting
 * Conjoint Analysis
 
 Typically, this would be used in the context of a dedicated short workshop where the
