#' The questionnaire comes with limitation as it can process not more than 5 groups
#' of maximum 5 indicators. Each indicators is associated to different levels that
#' will be then assessed through conjoint analysis for the weighting stage
#' 
#' After quadratic voting, it is expected that the facilitation of the result 
#' interpretation should allow to reduce the numbers of indicators to a maximum of
#' 12 indicators
